# BaseRepo

This repository contains a base .NET 8 Web API project generated manually.

To build and run the API locally (assuming the .NET SDK is installed):

```bash
# Restore dependencies and run the API
dotnet run --project BaseWebApi/BaseWebApi.csproj
```

Once the API is running you can retrieve sample data by navigating to
`/WeatherForecast` or the shorthand `/GetWeatherForecast`.
